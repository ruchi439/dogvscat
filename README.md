# 🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Identifier

This is a Deep Learning project that classifies whether an image contains a **dog** or a **cat** using **Transfer Learning** techniques.

##  Overview

The project leverages a **pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model (like MobileNetV2 or VGG16) to extract image features, and then trains a custom classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs. Transfer learning allows us to achieve high accuracy with limited training data and minimal training time.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Image Classification
- Transfer Learning
- Fine-tuning Pretrained CNN Models
- TensorFlow/Keras
